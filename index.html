        World's Top 10 Hottest Peppers 2021
    </h1>
   <p>
    Superhot chili peppers go beyond habanero pepper heat and surpass 350,000 Scoville Heat Units. Each year, the limits of how hot 
    peppers can get are pushed further, thanks to a community of dedicated superhot pepper breeders. Here's a list of the current hottest peppers in the world as of 2021:

   <h2> #10. Red Savina Habanero</h2>
   <img src="https://pepperhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Red-Savina-Habanero.jpg.webp" />
   <p>Back in the early years of super hots, the Red Savina Habanero was KING!

    It held the title of the World’s Hottest Pepper from 1994 to 2006. 12 Years!
    
    The Red Savina has since been dethroned and many peppers have passed it in heat, but still to this day it is one of my favorite peppers to grow because it has the perfect balance of heat and flavor.</p>

   <h2> #9. 7 Pot Red (Giant)</h2>
   <img src='https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0915/1060/products/7PotJonah_600x.png?v=1620234619'/>
   <p>The 7 pots were named after their ability to heat up 7 pots of stew and that it does! There are 100’s of varieties created from crossing this breed with other peppers. Some varieties include 7 Pot Jonah, 7 Pot Yellow, 7 Pot Katie, 7 Pot Barrackpore and countless others.</p>

   <h2> #8. 7 Pot Barrackpore</h2>
   <img src='https://pepperhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7-Pot-Barrackpore.jpg.webp'/>
   <p>The 7 Pot Barrackpore is one of the hottest of the 7 Pot peppers.

    This one is from the Town of Chaguanas in Trinidad and Tobago.
    
    Many of these “super hots” come from this region.</p>

   <h2> #7. Ghost Pepper (Bhut Jolokia)</h2>

   <p>The Ghost Pepper is the most famous “Super Hot” due to the amount of press it has received in the past. This is the first pepper to scientifically test over 1 million scovilles.</p>
   <p>Many mistakenly believe the Ghost Pepper is still the World’s Hottest pepper, this list shows it is far from it.</p>

   <h2> #6. Naga Viper</h2>
   <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Naga_Viper_486_orig.jpg'/>
   <p>Naga Viper is an extremely rare pepper cultivated in the UK. Hybrid of many different peppers and years of cross pollination created this variety of “Super HOT” pepper.

    It was never fully stabilized before being released so pod variation is expected.</p>

   <h2> #5. Trinidad Scorpion "Butch T"</h2>
   <img src='https://pepperhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Trinidad-Scorpion-Butch-T.jpg.webp'/>
   <p>The Trinidad Scorpion Butch T is a previous Guinness World Record Holder (2011) from Australia.

    No doubt it’s insanely hot, but other peppers have been proven to be hotter.
    
    It’s aptly named due to the scorpion stinger found at the tip of the pepper and also the creator, Butch Taylor.</p>

   <h2> #4. 7 Pot Primo</h2>
   <img src='https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/7-Pot-Primo.jpg'/>
   <p>The 7 Pot Primo is very distinctive with its long skinny “tail”.

    This pepper was created by horticulturist Troy Primeaux.
    
    Some peppers cultivators have tried to replicate the Primo look by breeding their own peppers to have a long stinger.</p>

   <h2> #3. 7 Pot Douglah</h2>
   <img src='https://pepperhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7-Pot-Douglah.jpg.webp'/>
   <p>Well renown in the pepper community as one of the hottest peppers with the best flavor.

    The 7 Pot Douglah is the hottest pepper you can find that isn’t red.
    
    The hottest “superhot” peppers are traditionally red, but the Douglah defies the odds by being brown AND scortching hot.
    
    You can’t go wrong with fresh, dried, or powdered Douglah on any food.
    
    Also known as 7 Pod Douglah, Chocolate 7 Pod or the 7 Pot Brown.</p>

   <h2> #2. Trinidad Moruga Scorpion</h2>

   <p>Not to be confused with the Trinidad Scorpion Butch T.</p><p>The Trinidad Moruga scorpion (Capsicum chinense) is a chili pepper native to the village of Moruga, Trinidad and Tobago. It is one of the spiciest chilies in the world. In 2012, New Mexico State University's Chile Pepper Institute identified the Trinidad Moruga scorpion as the hottest chili at that time, with heat of 1.2 million Scoville heat units (SHUs).</p>

   <p>The previous world champion, Carolina Reaper has been beat!  by itself… The Carolina Reaper is once again officially the Worlds Hottest Pepper.

    Originally ranked as world’s hottest in 2013, the Reaper was tested again in 2018 with an even higher SHU. (71,000 SHU higher to be exact) This gives the reaper a renewed title as World’s Hottest!
    
    It was bred for heat and that it is, with an average SHU of 1,641,000 SHU and peaks at 2.2 Million SHU!
    
    Let’s put the scoville rating into perspective for you: The Carolina Reaper pepper is 200x hotter than a Jalapeno</p>

   <h1>Possible Future Contenders</h1>
   <p>There are two possible future contenders for the title of "Hottest Pepper in the World". They're very new hybrid peppers whose Scoville Heat Unit claims have not been verified.</p>

   <h2>Dragon's Breath</h2>
  <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,h_1411,w_2119,x_3,y_0/v1555182770/shape/mentalfloss/iStock-513992739.jpg?itok=Z5tz4Lw1" />
  <p><strong>Dragon's Breath</strong> is a chili pepper cultivar officially tested at 2.48 million Scoville units, a claim that would make it the second-hottest chili on record after Pepper X (which also remains unconfirmed by Guinness World Records as of 2021). "Guinness World Records" has different accredited results on the matter, showing the Carolina Reaper as the hottest in the world.</p>
   <h3>2,483,584 SHU (supposedly)</h3>

   <h2>Pepper X</h2>
   <img src="https://pepperhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pepper-x-1400x793.jpg.webp" />
   <p><strong>Pepper X:</strong> another pepper claiming to be TWICE as hot as the Carolina Reaper has surfaced, but this might have more merit. Very limited information is known about Pepper X as the breeder, Ed Currie (who also created the Carolina Reaper) has kept it under wraps.</p>
   <h3>4,400,000 SHU (supposedly)</h3>
